We forked Redash https://redash.io and we are grateful to the Redash for the possibility to quickly build our initial product version.

When forking an original work, it is important to appreciate the effort and value of the original creators while also acknowledging the need for changes and improvements. We believe that the best way to do this is to be transparent about our intentions and to give credit to the original creators and contributors.

Our approach involves collaborating with the community to contribute back to the original project if possible while also maintaining a separate codebase for our own project.
