Dingolytics
===========

This is a Dingolytics web application.

We are going to revise the UI and change it sagnificantly, starting from commit [ad7d30f](https://github.com/getredash/redash/tree/ad7d30f91de64a291eb89892c713bd0067c47ecc), actually to serve another purpose.

While Redash is focused on top-level analytics, Dingolytics is more focused
on digging into the data. It is more a tool for developers, data engineers
and data scientists than for business analysts.

Our focus is on:

- Hands-on data exploration: logs, metrics, events, etc.
- Easily configured ingestion pipelines
- Serving as monitoring and observability platform
